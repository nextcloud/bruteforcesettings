	<description><![CDATA[Brute Force Protection is meant to protect Nextcloud servers from attempts to
guess account passwords in various ways. Besides the obvious "*let's try a big
list of commonly used passwords*" attack, it also makes it harder to use
slightly more sophisticated attacks via the reset password form or trying to
find app password tokens.

If triggered, brute force protection makes requests coming from an IP on a
bruteforce protected controller with the same API slower for a 24 hour period.

With this app, the admin can exempt an IP address or range from this
protection which can be useful for testing purposes or when there are false
positives due to a lot of accounts on one IP address.]]></description>
